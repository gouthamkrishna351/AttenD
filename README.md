# attend

Attend is an android application made using Flutter that represents the culmination of innovative technology and practical utility, offering a transformative solution to the age-old challenge of attendance tracking. Developed as a capstone project, Attend harnesses the power of Near Field Communication (NFC) to revolutionize the way attendance is recorded and managed. With AttenD, gone are the days of cumbersome manual entry and error-prone record-keeping. Instead, users can effortlessly mark attendance with a simple tap, utilizing the seamless integration of NFC technology. This intuitive approach not only saves valuable time and resources but also ensures unparalleled accuracy and reliability.
